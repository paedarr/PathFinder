## An Interactive MIPS Datapath Program
This program is a work in progress.

The main program is present in **mainProgram.html** and **MAINscript.js**. This is where the majority of the time and effort is spent. Have completed a few R-Type Instructions, need to complete J and I Types. (As well as some more R-Types)
